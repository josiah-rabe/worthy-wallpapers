# worthy-wallpapers

## An Introduction
Daily, and ever since the beginning of time, human existance has churned and tumbled. Civilizatoins have risen only to fall, countless wars have been waged, philosophies have failed to explain reality, and yet, we continue, without fanfare, to stare at our screens. Upon those screens, before we even find the cursor or the text editor with that essay due tomorrow, we, assuming we are using an average graphical interface, are greeted with an image. We call it a wallpaper.
This repository, therefore, is not merely a collection of pretty pictures sized to 16:9. It is an archive of moods, of seasons, of subconscious choices and associations that, in their own way, shape how I remember entire periods of my life. So to catalog them here is to accept and acknowledge that even the default backgrout is never neutral. It nudges, tastes, and feels. It has become, dare I say it, *worthy*.
Contained within the aforementioned repository are the wallpapers I have deemed significant so to preserve, not only for their indubious aesthetic merit, but also for the personal history they hold. 
So go on. Browse at your leisure. Or don't. Either way, the wallpapers shall remain.
*Usque ad finem GitHubi stet, usque ad consummationem terrae. Amen.*

## A Slightly Less Satirical Guide
